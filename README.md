# Project Name : Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning
> Outline a brief description of your project.
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
